## Project Title
Find your hat
## Description
This started as a project to be run in Node that I completed as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path (see code here https://github.com/evg4/Find-my-hat). I then decided I wanted to see if I could adapt it for use in the browser, so I copied my original code, added HTML and CSS files, and updated the JavaScript as needed to make it work in the web. There are some parts I would like to change, and I may come back to in the future, but for now I am happy with my solution. Like the original version, this is a game where the user must navigate through a randomly-generated field to find their hat. I completed this on 25/07/23.
## Features
This is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## How to use
This game can be played in the browser. Open the page then press any key to start. See instructions on the page for more details.
## Technologies
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Areas for development
Some things that I would like to improve upon, once I have learnt the necessary skills, are as follows:
* Allow users to select the size of the field. At the moment it is set to 3x4.
* Have the movement work by just pressing keys, rather than needing the prompt box every time.
* If the user goes out of bounds, display a red X in the position where they tried to navigate along with the "You lose!" message.
* Add in the functionality to only print fields where a solution (i.e. clear path to the hat) is possible.
* Find a way to make a version that works on touch-screen devices.
* Allow users to change difficulty levels by, for example, increaasing or decreasing the amount of holes in the field, or starting somewhere other than the top left corner.
