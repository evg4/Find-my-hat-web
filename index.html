    <h1>Find your hat ðŸ‘’</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Aim:</strong><br /><br />Get to your hat without falling down a
      hole or straying beyond the field! <br /><br />
      <strong>Instructions:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>You will start at the position marked ðŸ‘£.</li>
      <li>
        Green squares ðŸŸ© represent a safe path. Black squares â¬› represent
        holes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a look at the game field - does it look like there is a safe path
        to your hat? Fields are generated at random so there may be no safe
        route! If that is the case, feel free to refresh until you see a field
        you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you're ready to play, press any key. You will then be prompted for
        your move: D is down, U is up, L is left, and R is right.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you fall down a hole, you lose. If you step outside the boundaries of
        the game, you lose. If your move was safe, the field will update to
        display your path.
      </li>
      <li>Press any key again to take your next move.</li>
      <li>Keep going until you reach your hat!</li>
    </ol>
